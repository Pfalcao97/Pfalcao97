Hello everyone,my name is Pedro and I'm a mechanical engineer, turned Python Developer, based in Brasil. I currently work as a Product Developer in a marketing company from São José dos Campos (SP) called O2 Agency. During my day-to-day I use SQL, many different APIs and popular python modules such as: Pandas, GeoPandas, PILLOW, Requests, JSON and more. I also explore the web looking for exciting inovations, specially cool new modules and machine learning aplications.

During my free time I enjoy cooking and playing music. I also enjoy studying and learning new things, so I'm always reading and doing some new online courses, during this time I'm doing Google's [Data Analyst professional course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) on Coursera. For those who speak portuguese, I also enjoy doing some written science communication work in my blog [À Jusante](https://ajusanteciencia.wordpress.com/), where I speak about engineering, sciente and mathematics.

I'm open for collaboration, specially in the topics of **Data Analysis**, **Science and Engineering**, **Mathematical Optimization**, **Physical Simulations** and **Audio-visual projects**. Specially for **Open-Source** projects. Besides my work, I'm currently working in a tool for quickly creating video clips.

You can reach me via [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pfalcao97/), if you want to talk about a collaboration project. I am fluent in Portuguese and English, and conversational in French and Spanish.
