Hello everyone,my name is Pedro and I'm a mechanical engineer, turned Data Scientist, based in Brasil. I currently work as a Full Data Scientist in large Brazilian retailer called Oscar Calçados. During my day-to-day I use SQL, many different APIs and popular python modules such as: Pandas, GeoPandas, PILLOW, Requests, JSON and more. I also explore the web looking for exciting inovations, specially cool new modules and machine learning aplications. I'm currently developing a dynamic pricing algorithm from scratch!

I'm currently learning Rust on my free time - So I'm open for any colaborations in Rust projects, or just talk about this cool new language!

During my free time I enjoy cooking and playing music. I also enjoy studying and learning new things, so I'm always reading and doing some new online courses. For those who speak portuguese, I also enjoy writing science communication in my blog [À Jusante](https://ajusanteciencia.wordpress.com/), for subjects like engineering, science and mathematics.

I'm open for collaboration, specially in the topics of **Data Analysis**, **Science and Engineering**, **Mathematical Optimization**, **Physical Simulations** and **Audio-visual projects**. Specially those that are **Open-Source**. 

You can reach me via [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pfalcao97/), if you want to talk about a collaboration project. I am fluent in Portuguese and English, and conversational in French and Spanish.
