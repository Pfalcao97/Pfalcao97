- 👋 Hi, I’m Pedro, a mechanical engineer based in Brasil.

- 👀 I’m interested in creating physical simulations, to better visualise dynamical systems, animating videos and creating games through code and many other little projects!

- 🌱 I’ve been, on and off, learning python throughout the last few years, i've yet to build anything of great value in it. I've also learned C, C++ and Matlab during school, but 
I'd like to learn other languages, like C#, Java and HTML.

- 💞️ I’d love to help in open-source projects, as i'm a greatly interested in the open-source philosophy. I'm also interested in contributing with scientific and engineering projects.
